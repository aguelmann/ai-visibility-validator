- Name: AI & LLM Visibility Validator (update title and copy)
- Remove references to Google and their AI tools/features; instead, make sure to always mention, when relevant, ChatGPT, Claude & Perplexity
- Redesign the above the fold section to add a text input field directly in the landing page for the visitor to input and test their page/website. The idea is for the visitor to land on this page and be able to check their website/page as soon as possible.
- Keep the result page (the one based on the popup) just to show the result. 
- For the blocks with examples of TTFB & CLS & INP, use results that are in the red and yellow, and make these blocks smaller (or combine the target metrics next to them).
- Move the Timeout Wall block to be the first one; this "wall" is a bigger factor in terms of AI visibility, only after that the race conditions are relevant (since they are some sort of ranking)
- In the What You'll Discover section, use this order for the blocks (still 3 at a time horizontally):

1. TTFB Analysis (mentioning both the timeout wall and the race conditions - this should be the case on the whole website/tool)
2. CLS for AI Parsing
3. INP for Agents
4. Real User Data
5. Page & Origin
6. Actionable Insights
